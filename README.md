Class-icVehicles is a TypeScript command-line interface (CLI) application that demonstrates object-oriented programming principles through a simulated vehicle builder and driving experience. This project showcases how different vehicle classes can inherit properties and behaviors by implementing interfaces or extending classes.

## Description

Class-icVehicles is an updated version of an existing TypeScript application that allows users to:

- Create new vehicles (cars, trucks, or motorbikes) or select existing vehicles
- Enter specific details for each vehicle type
- Simulate driving experiences and perform vehicle-specific actions through the command line
- Continuously perform actions with a selected vehicle until choosing to exit

The project emphasizes class-based architecture, inheritance concepts, and TypeScript implementation in object-oriented programming.
